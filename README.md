# 🕵️‍♂️ Cheating Detector

A web-based application that detects suspicious activity patterns during online tests by analyzing event logs from CSV files. This tool helps educators and examiners identify potential cheating behavior without using invasive video surveillance.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Upload test log CSV files for analysis.
- 📊 Generate visual reports (charts and tables) to highlight suspicious activity.
- 👤 View detailed activity breakdown for each user.
- ⚠️ Flash-based error messages for invalid inputs.
- 🔐 Secure and lightweight Flask application.

---

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (via templates)
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas
- **Visualization:** Chart.js (via Jinja templates)
- **Storage:** Local file system (`uploads/` folder)

## 🧪 Sample Input Format (CSV)

Your CSV should include at least the following columns:

| user_id | timestamp           | event_type   |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| user123 | 2024-01-01 10:00:00 | start_test   |
| user123 | 2024-01-01 10:05:10 | tab_switch   |
| user123 | 2024-01-01 10:45:00 | end_test     |

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cheating_detector.git
   cd cheating_detector
````

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open in your browser:**

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## 📈 How It Works

* Upload a `.csv` file with user activity logs.
* The app uses `detector.py` to:

  * Parse timestamps.
  * Count suspicious events (e.g., tab switches, focus shifts).
  * Generate summary reports and charts.
* View aggregated reports or drill down into user-level activity details.

---

## 🛡️ Disclaimer

This tool provides **risk-based indicators** of suspicious behavior. It is not a replacement for formal proctoring but rather a supportive mechanism for identifying anomalies in user activity.

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Ideas)

* Add authentication and user roles (admin vs. examiner).
* Support Excel file input (.xlsx).
* Risk scoring and categorization.
* Export reports as PDF.
* Integration with LMS systems.
